# CoffeePot

CoffeePot will be a CoffeeScript compiler written in pure CoffeeScript.  For those who haven't heard about it yet, CoffeeScript is a language that directly compiles down to pure JS.  The current compiler is written in Ruby, but it would be nice to have one that's native.  Then you could compile in the browser, or server-side with rhino or node.

Currently the compiler can compile a subset of CoffeeScript.

A live example is available at <http://trycoffee.org>

The public folder has a fully usable distribution of coffeescript that can be used for both browsers and commonjs environments.

More to come soon...
